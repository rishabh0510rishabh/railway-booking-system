### Core Booking Functionality
Train Search: Users can search for trains by source and destination, with optional filters for different times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening).

Dynamic Booking System: The system handles seat allocation based on availability, assigning statuses like Confirmed, RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation), or Waitlisted.

PNR Status Check: Users can check the status of a ticket using a unique PNR number.

### Journey & Travel Planning
Detailed Train Routes: A dedicated page displays the full route of a train, including all stops and their arrival times.

Return Journey Suggestion: The system can intelligently suggest and direct the user to a return journey train based on their original booking.

### Ticket Generation & Output
Printable E-Ticket: A clean, printer-friendly HTML version of the ticket is available.

The application uses an SQLite database with the following models:

User: Stores user credentials and profile information.

Train: Contains details about each train, including its route, departure, arrival, and total seats.

Route: A child model of Train that stores individual stops along a train's journey.
